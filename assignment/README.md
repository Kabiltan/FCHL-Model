# Kernel Method Assignment

The goal of this assignment is to evaluate your ability to fit Kernel ridge regression models on chemical data.

- [ ] Manipulate Pandas dataframes of chemical data
- [ ] Convert molecular structures from string to ASE format
- [ ] Compare model performance using cross-validation tests
- [ ] Optimize model hyperparameters

As you complete this assignment, you will learn how to bypass some issues of kernel ridge regression and a little about global optimization algorithms.
